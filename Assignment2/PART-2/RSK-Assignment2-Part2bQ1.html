  <p> <a name="Q1"> Q1 Ans : The name change process if the Aadhar data is changed is similar to other change requests. Member has to apply online and employer will digitally approve the request. The correction request can be submitted online or offline (joint request) along with a copy of the marriage certificate or such other documents which can prove that only the name of the member has changed from before marriage. Documents like school records containing Father's name and Date of birth or PAN taken before marriage etc. are a useful to show that only name has changed after marriage.</a> <br><br> <a href="RSK-Assignment2-Part2a.html#top"> Go back to Questions Section </a><br><br></p>
