  <p> <a name="Q14"> Q14 Ans : Yes. In order to get maximum benefits, you are requested to transfer all the previous services (linked with multiple member IDs) to the latest member ID. This can be done by filing a transfer claim. Once the service is successfully transferred your entire PF corpus will reflect against the latest member ID. Subsequently you can file COVID advance claim to reap maximum benefit. </a> <br><br> <a href="RSK-Assignment2-Part2a.html#top"> Go back to Questions Section </a><br><br></p>
